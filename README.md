# MessengerClone
# ðŸ“± MessengerClone

A simple **Messenger-style chat app UI** built using **.NET MAUI**. This project focuses on the **UI and navigation** only â€” no backend or real-time chat is implemented yet.

It uses clean architecture practices to simulate a messaging app experience with:
- A Welcome screen
- A Chat List (contact/conversation previews)
- A Chat Page with message bubbles
- Basic Shell-based navigation
